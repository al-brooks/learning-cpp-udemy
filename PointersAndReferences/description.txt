Pointer & References Challenge Instructions:
->  Write a C++ function named apply_all that:
    - Expects two arrays of integers and their sizes
    - Dynamically allocates a new array of integers:
        -> Whose size is the PRODUCT of the 2 array sizes
->  The function should loop through the second array and:
    - Multiply each element across each element of Array 1
    - Store the products in the newly created array.
->  The function should return a pointer to the newly allocated array

Also:
->  You can write a print function that expects:
    - A pointer to an int array
    - And its size

Example:

int array1[] {1,2,3,4,5);
int array2[] {10,20,30};

cout << "Array 1";
print(array1, 5);

cout << "Array 2";
print(array2, 3);

int *results = apply_all(array1, 5, array2, 3);
cout << "Result: ";
print(results, 15);

 Output
 ---------------------
 Array 1: [ 1 2 3 4 5 ]
 Array 2: [ 10 20 30 ]
 Result: [ 10 20 30 40 50 20 40 60 80 100 30 60 90 120 150 ]
